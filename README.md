I recently completed my first professional project for a client, a React application built with Vite. The project is hosted on Vercel at [chatapp-inky-mu.vercel.app.](https://chatapp-inky-mu.vercel.app/)

To optimize development, I utilized the @vitejs/plugin-react which leverages Babel for Fast Refresh, ensuring a smooth and efficient coding experience. Additionally, I explored @vitejs/plugin-react-swc, which uses SWC for Fast Refresh, providing an alternative approach for enhancing development speed.
